/**
 * When you create a documentation page, please add the file name to the list below.
 * Note: Case sensitive, but don't include the extension (`.md`)
 * 
 * Documentation pages can have aliases. To do this, put the name and aliases in an array like ["filename", "alias", "alias2", ...]
 * Titles are automatically generated from the original page's name.
 *
 * So, the format is as follows:
 * ["exact/file-path/from-docs-directory", "an/alias/path", "another-alias/path"]
